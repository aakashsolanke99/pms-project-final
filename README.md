# Capstone - Practice Management System

- A web-based application used as an interface for the patients to book their appointment
based on the available physician timings. The booked appointments can be accepted or
rejected by the physician and the approved appointments will be listed for the nurse to
enter basic diagnosis and health information.
Once the nurse completed entering basic diagnosis information of the patient for the visit, it
will be queued to the doctor to further enter the medication details during his consultation
with the patients. Patients can access their health record at any time.
